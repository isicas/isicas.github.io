				<strong>Title: </strong>Resistive Crossbars as Matrix-Vector Multiplication Engine for Machine Learning Applications: Opportunities and Challenges<br>
				<strong>Abstract: </strong> 
				Traditional computing systems based on von Neumann architectures are fundamentally bottle-necked by the transfer speeds between memory and processor. With growing computational needs of today’s application space, dominated by Machine Learning (ML) workloads, there is a need to design special purpose computing systems operating on the principle of co-located memory and processing units. Such an approach, commonly known as ‘In-memory computing’, can potentially eliminate expensive data movement costs by computing inside the memory array itself. To that effect, crossbars based on resistive switching Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) devices has shown immense promise in serving as the building blocks of in-memory computing systems, as their high storage density can overcome scaling challenges that plague CMOS technology today. Adding to that, the ability of resistive crossbars to accelerate the main computational kernel of ML workloads by performing massively parallel, in-situ matrix vector multiplication (MVM) operations, makes them a promising candidate for building area and energy-efficient systems. However, the analog computing nature in resistive crossbars introduce approximations in MVM computations due to device and circuit level nonidealities. Further, analog systems pose high cost peripheral circuit requirements for conversions between the analog and digital domain. Thus, there is a need to understand the entire system design stack, from device characteristics to architectures, and perform effective hardware-software co-design to truly realize the potential of resistive crossbars as future computing systems. In this talk, we will present a comprehensive overview of NVM crossbars for accelerating ML workloads. We describe, in detail, the design principles of the basic building blocks, such as the device and associated circuits, that constitute the crossbars. We explore non-idealities arising from the device characteristics and circuit behavior and study their impact on MVM functionality of NVM crossbars for machine learning hardware.<br><br>

				<strong>Title: </strong>Software-defined AI Chip - from the perspective of Architecture Innovation<br>
				<strong>Abstract: </strong> 
				Over the past three decades, Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) is employed to meet specific system requirements. A wide variety and small size are the advantages of ASIC. However, the diversity of applications contradicts the high investment in ASIC R&D with the process technology going to 1Xnm. To realize an ASIC corresponding to the application in a low-cost way, a hardware scheme with the same topology as the C/C++ description should be the most direct implementation and the most efficient as well. Reconfigurable chip is both software and hardware programable. The hardware architecture and functions change dynamically in real-time with the change of software algorithm while ensuring flexibility. Thus it is also called a software-defined chip. The wide adaptability of the software-defined chip makes it a strong competitor to replace ASIC, FPGA, and general-purpose processors. 				
				
				Artificial intelligence (AI) is ubiquitous and AI chip has become a research hotspot in recent years. AI algorithms vary in different applications and the algorithms will continue to evolve. AI services are migrating from the cloud to the edge nowadays. Performance demands and power consumption constraints require AI to deployed on an energy-efficient computing engine. Reconfigurable architecture is the ideal solution for intelligent computing since its programmability and dynamic reconfigurability of architecture can adapt algorithm evolution and diversity of applications and greatly improves energy efficiency as well.
				
				Dynamically reconfigurable technology brings the ability to bear the diversity and evolution of AI algorithms. Software-defined AI chips are expected to provide a new route for China's chip technology to get rid of imitation.

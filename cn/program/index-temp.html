				<strong>Title: Design of a 4.2-to-5.1 GHz Ultralow-Power Complementary Class-B/C Hybrid-Mode VCO in 65-nm CMOS Fully Supported by EDA Tools</strong> </br>

				Optimal voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) design for ultralow-power (ULP) radios has to fulfill simultaneously multiple requirements such as frequency tuning range, phase noise, power consumption, and frequency pushing. The manual design struggles to approach the full potential that a given topology can achieve. In this work, we prove the role of electronic design automation (EDA) tools by fully supporting the complex design of a ULP complementary Class-B/C hybrid-mode VCO. In the 1st step of the EDA-assisted flow, we perform a worst-case corner of worst-case tuning sizing optimization over a 108- dimensional performance space, offering sizing solutions with power consumption down to 145 µW at the worst-case. In the 2nd step, we introduce an automatic layout generation tool to offer valuable insights into the post-layout design space and devise a ready-for-tape-out fine optimization strategy. The hybrid-mode VCO prototyped in 65-nm CMOS occupies a die area of 0.165 mm2 and dissipates 297 µW from a 0.8 V supply at 5.1 GHz. The phase noise at 1 MHz offset is -110.1 dBc/Hz, resulting in a competitive Figure-of-Merit (FoM) of 189.4 dBc/Hz well-suited for ULP applications.</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, a digitally controlled voltage-mode buck converter with embedded transient improvement using delay line-based control techniques is presented. Two voltage-controlled delay lines (VCDL’s) are used to convert the difference between the feedback and reference voltages to a delay time difference. The delay difference is then fed to the multiple-outputs bang-bang phase detector (MOBBPD), which converts the input delay difference to multiple-bits digital codes in a simple nonlinear way. The MOBBPD scheme leads to high resolution for small output ripple and improved response when large load transient happens in a low-cost way. A digital loop filter (DLF) accumulates the MOBBPD output codes to control the duty cycle through a novel digital pulse width modulator (DPWM) to regulate the output voltage. By designing the coefficients of the DLF, a type-II compensator can be achieved through the integral and proportional paths to make the loop stable. The proposed DPWM, which consists of a divide-by-8 frequency divider, two delay lines and a few simple digital logics, achieves a wide tunable range of duty cycle under various process corners and supply voltages. A proof-of-concept design of the proposed buck converter was fabricated in a standard 0.18 μm CMOS technology. The measured results show that it achieves a very wide output voltage range from 0.1 V to 3.5 V for a input supply range from 2.4 V to 3.6 V. With a 400 mA step in the load current, the overshoot/undershoot is less than 87 mV and the 1% settling time is less than 16 μs. The peak efficiency is 95.2% with 250 mA load current at 2.4 V output voltage with 3.3 V input voltage.</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents a millimeter-wave phasedarray receiver front-end with compact size and low-power consumption. A combination of local oscillator (LO) and radio frequency (RF) phase-shifting schemes is used to reduce the power consumption and RF path loss. Moreover, in the implementation of active circuits, a bulk isolation technique is used to achieve a higher power gain with a minimum number of stages. This technique is also utilized in the RF path phase shifter switches to mitigate the loss. To validate the proposed architecture, a single-element 56-to-66 GHz phased-array receiver front-end is fabricated in a 65-nm bulk CMOS process. Based on the measurement results, the receiver achieves a power gain of ~14.85 dB and a minimum noise figure (NF) of 5.7 dB. The measured average RMS phase and gain errors are ~3.5° and ~0.45 dB, respectively. The input 1-dB compression point (P-1dB) of the receiver chain is about –19 dBm. The complete receiver, including active balun and required buffers (excluding the LO), consumes ~50 mW from a 1-V power supply and excluding the pads occupies a silicon area of 0.93 mm2.</br>

				<strong>Title: Spur Minimization Techniques for Ultra-Low-Power Injection-Locked Transmitters</strong> </br>
				<strong>Authors:</strong> Chung-Ching Lin, Huan Hu, and Subhanshu Gupta</br>
				<strong>Institutes:</strong> Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA</br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> Frequency multiplying wireless transmitters (TX) employing harmonic injection-locked technique benefit from high energy efficiency and less hardware complexity but largely suffer from reference spurs that violate the TX spectral specifications. This work proposes a self-aligned phase-locked loop (PLL) in conjunction with harmonic injection locking technique to achieve significantly improved spur performance under ultra-low-power (ULP) operations for sub-GHz IoT TXs. The on-chip type-I PLL calibrates the phase error in the ring oscillator (RO) in real-time and avoids large spurs induced from the frequency deviation in the harmonic injection locking. A compact zero power consumption twin-T notch filter for spur suppression is implemented within the PLL loop to tackle the rail-to-rail voltage jump that comes from the output of the phase detector (PD). Designed and fabricated in the TSMC 180 nm CMOS process, the proposed frequency multiplying TX occupies an active area of only 0.0413 mm2. The lowest power consumption with >3X improved energy-efficiency is observed while consistently achieving >62 dB spur suppression with -14 dBm output at 915 MHz. The TX supports OOK modulation with an average power consumption of 200.9 µW only at 3 Mb/s data rate achieving a normalized 66.97 pJ/bit energy efficiency.</br>

				<strong>Title: A -40°C to 120°C, 169 ppm/°C Nano-Ampere CMOS Current Reference </strong> </br>
				<strong>Authors:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Institutes:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This brief presents a nano-ampere CMOS current reference (CCR) for low power application with a wide temperature range from -40 °C to 120 °C. The current reference is generated by the division of a temperature-independent voltage and resistance in a simple way. The low temperature-independent voltage is generated based on the threshold voltage difference between two same-type NMOS transistors with different channel lengths working in the subthreshold region, while the temperature-independent resistance is made up by two poly resistors, whose temperature coefficients are opposite. By designing a low voltage to allow for a small resistance, the CCR circuit takes a small chip area while generating nano-ampere current. The proposed CCR circuit was implemented in a standard !%#,- CMOS process and its active area is 0.054 mm2 . Among the measured 10 samples, the average output current is 11.6 nA and the average temperature coefficient is 169 ppm/°C.</br>

				<strong>Title: A 15-Gb/s 0.0037-mm2 0.019-pJ/Bit Full-Rate Programmable Multi-Pattern Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence Generator</strong> </br>
				<strong>Authors:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Institutes:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This brief presents a compact low-power programmable multi-pattern pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) generator. It is capable of producing 27-1, 215-1, 223-1 and 231-1 test patterns to meet multiple testing requirements. To reduce power and area, the full-rate architecture with the truly-single-phase clock logic (TSPC) D-flip-flops (DFF) instead of the current-mode logic (CML) DFF is adopted. The multiplexer (MUX) merged TSPC DFF is proposed to avoid the delay of the MUX in conventional multiple pattern PRBS generators. Hence, the critical path delay is reduced, and thus, the maximum data rate can be improved. Fabricated in a 40-nm CMOS process (260-GHz fT), this PRBS occupies a core active area of 0.0037 mm2 and operates at a maximum data rate of 15 Gb/s. The measured power consumption is 8.778 mW with 1.1-V supply. The figure-of-merit (FoM) is 0.019 pJ/bit at the pattern length of 231-1.</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> A power and area-efficient pulse-amplitude modulation 4 (PAM-4) transmitter using 3-tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE) based on a slow-wave transmission line is presented. Passive delay line is adopted for generating equalizer tap to overcome the high clocking power consumption.

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has attained high accuracy and it has been widely employed in image recognition tasks. In recent times, deep learning-based modern applications are evolving and it poses a challenge in research and development of hardware implementation. Therefore, hardware optimization for efficient accelerator design of CNN remains a challenging task. A key component of the accelerator design is a processing element (PE) that implements the convolution operation. To reduce the amount of hardware resources and power consumption, this article provides a new processing element design as an alternate solution for hardware implementation. Modified BOOTH encoding (MBE) multiplier and WALLACE tree-based adders are proposed to replace bulky MAC units and typical adder tree respectively. The proposed CNN accelerator design is tested on Zynq-706 FPGA board which achieves a throughput of 87.03 GOP/s for Tiny-YOLO-v2 architecture. The proposed design allows to reduce hardware costs by 24.5% achieving a power efficiency of 61.64 GOP/s/W that outperforms the previous designs.</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> A dual-output CMOS voltage reference is presented for ultra-low power applications that require two or more different voltage references. The VREF1 is designed by employing the VTH difference between two devices to compensate the temperature coefficient (TC) of the thermal voltage. The VREF2 is generated by feeding a current mirrored from the first reference voltage’s supply current into a diode-connected-transistor load. In such a way, two different voltage references can be generated in one compact and simple design to reduce the devices and chip area significantly, compared to two separate voltage references in a conventional design. Fabricated in a 0.18-μm CMOS process, the proposed CMOS voltage reference can provide two references of 331.8 and 660.3 mV with variation coefficients of 0.53% and 0.42%, respectively. The average TCs of VREF1 and VREF2 for a temperature range of -40 to 125ºC are measured as 41.7 and 24.5 ppm/oC, respectively. The line sensitivity (LS) of VREF1 is 0.0505 %/V with 0.6-1.8 V supply, and the LS of VREF2 is 0.114 %/V with 0.8-1.8 V supply. The measured results show a competitive power supply ripple rejection, and the power consumption is only 4.12 nW with 0.8-V minimum supply at 25oC, while the active area is 0.0108 mm2.</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper aims to reduce the power consumption of electrocardiography based wearable healthcare devices, by introducing power reduction approaches and considerations at system level design, where we have the highest potential to influence power. It focuses, in particular, on algorithm design and implementation, data acquisition, and transmission under constrained resources. A thorough investigation of the suitability of nine existing algorithms for on-sensor QRS feature detection is conducted, with respect to metrics such as sensitivity, positive predictivity, power consumption, parameter choice and time delay. Optimization of data acquisition on CPU-based IoT systems is performed, and the current consumption is reduced by thrice using a combination of direct memory access (DMA) list approach and low-level register manipulations for task delegation. The acquisition data rate, sampling rate, buffer and batch size are also optimised. To reduce the power consumption by data transmission, the effect of on-sensor versus off-sensor processing is investigated. While focusing on the CPU-based system with experiments performed on a generic low-power wearable platform, the design optimization and considerations proposed in this work could extend to custom designs and allow further investigation into QRS detection algorithm optimization for wearable devices.</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents a comparison of several artificial intelligence (AI) based binary classifiers for detecting the integrity of data obtained from Internet of Things (IoT) enabled wearable sensors. Detecting the integrity of data at the network edge facilitates the elimination of corrupted or unusable data, which translates to a lower amount of data stored and transmitted. This reduces the storage and power requirements of IoT devices without a reduction in functionality. In this work, we explore several machine learning-based classifiers to check the integrity of electrocardiogram (ECG) data. The feature vectors are derived from low complexity kurtosis and skewness based Signal Quality Indices (SQIs). From the experiments, it is found that a bagged ensemble of 3 neural networks achieves the highest detection accuracy of 99.47 %. We also estimated the complexity and power consumed by the various classifier implementations and classifier fusion implementations. The energy consumed by the ensemble classifier was estimated to be around 0.039 nJ</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> Energy-efficient timer circuits are required in numerous applications for periodic operations, such as performing measurements and communicating data. In this paper, we present a gate-leakage-based timer that utilizes an amplifier-less replica-bias switching technique to generate a stable frequency, which can operate at a low supply voltage. To guarantee a stable oscillation frequency in a small circuit area, the proposed design adopts an architecture that discharges a pre-charged capacitor through a resistive element (gate-leaking MOS capacitor) with a low-leakage switch. In the proposed switching technique, the low-voltage timer operates by tracking the discharging terminal of the capacitor and biasing the reference voltages of two switch units, thereby enabling the minimization of the leakage current without the need for analog amplifier circuits. The high supply sensitivity of the timer is addressed by regulating the supply voltage using a native NMOS header (NNH). The proposed design is fabricated using the 55-nm deeply depleted channel (DDC) CMOS technology, which has a strong body coefficient and occupies an active circuit area of 0.0022 mm2 . The measurements show that the proposed design can achieve an energy-per-cycle value of 25 pJ/cycle at a supply voltage of 350 mV when body biasing is applied. The measured Allan deviation floor is 200 ppm at room temperature. The timer exhibits an average temperature sensitivity of 810 ppm/◦C for four samples. Moreover, a reduction in the supply sensitivity by a factor of 26 using the NNH is demonstrated in an active circuit area of 0.0034 mm2.</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> In this brief, we present a hardware efficient implementation of a threshold modified min-sum algorithm (MSA) to improve the performance of a low density parity-check (LDPC) decoder. The proposed architecture introduces a novel lookup table based threshold attenuation technique, called threshold attenuated MSA (TAMSA). The proposed TAMSA implementation is shown to improve bit error rate (BER) performance compared to the conventional AMSA and MSA with no extra hardware cost. Furthermore, a layered version of the TAMSA implementation is investigated to reduce hardware cost. Utilizing circuit optimization techniques, including a parallel computing structure, the proposed layered TAMSA field programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation results show that the modified architecture requires no extra circuit power or circuit area compared to conventional AMSA, and 0.07 extra leaf cells compared to conventional MSA.</br>

				<strong>Authors:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Institutes:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents a digital capacitive MEMS microphone for speech recognition with fast wake-up feature using a sound activity detector. The proposed microphone wakes up only when an acoustic event within the voice-band occurs using the sound activity detector, which can significantly reduce the average current consumption. All wake-up processes are performed on-chip, which enables the fast wake-up feature to prevent missing keywords. In addition, the proposed deglitching technique is applied to prevent the sound activity detector from responding to non-acoustic signals such as glitch signals. An auxiliary low-dropout regulator is used to further reduce the wake-up time. Our microphone consumes only 16 µA in deep-sleep mode. In active mode, a high-performance readout circuit converts the voice signal into a digital signal. The proposed microphone achieves an A-weighted signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 62.8 dBA and an acoustic overload point of 119.4 dB sound pressure level. The readout circuit itself of our microphone, fabricated in a 0.18 µm CMOS process, has an A-weighted SNR of 65.8 dBA.</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper proposes a fully integrated step-down switched-capacitor (SC) DC-DC converter using 0.18-µm CMOS technology for system-on-chip applications. The proposed stepdown switched-capacitor DC-DC converter used two control mechanisms: the switch array modulation technique to regulate the output voltage and the voltage ripple modulation technique to adjust the output voltage ripple of the converter as the loading current varied. As a result, the proposed converter could generate a regulated output voltage with low voltage ripple. The converter core performed at conversion ratios of 1/3 and 1/2 under an input voltage of 1.8 V. The measurement results on 180-nm technology showed that the proposed fully integrated step-down switchedcapacitor DC-DC converter could achieve a peak power conversion efficiency of 74.1% and maintain power conversion efficiency at levels over 70% within loading ranges between 1.4 and 5 mA. The output voltage ripple was controlled at levels under 63.4 mV within a loading current ranging between 0.1 and 5 mA.</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This brief presents an energy-efficient elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) processor for Internet of Things (IoT) security applications. The proposed processor supports dual-field computations, and employs various design techniques across the algorithm, architecture, and arithmetic circuit levels to minimize power and energy consumption.

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> We present in this paper a novel multi-stage noiseshaping (MASH) 3-1 continuous-time (CT) delta-sigma modulator (∆ΣM) with gated ring oscillator based quantizers (GROQs) in both stages of the cascade. The use of GROQs increases the linearity performance with respect to the conventional voltage controlled oscillator based quantizers (VCOQs) and allows a more robust extraction of the front-end stage quantization error in the time domain, thus making the proposed architecture more suitable to implement high-order expandable scaling-friendly MASH ∆ΣMs, in which the back-end stages are implemented by mostly-digital GRO-based time-to-digital converters (TDCs). The circuit has been fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS technology with 1-V supply voltage, and it operates at 640-MHz sampling frequency to digitize 10-MHz signals. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first reported experimental validation of a GRO-based CT MASH ∆ΣM, featuring a 79.8-dB signal to noise ratio (SNR) at −2.2-dBFS, a 77.3-dB signal to (noise + distortion) ratio (SNDR) at −4-dBFS and a dynamic range (DR) of 81.7 dB, with a power consumption of 12-mW. These metrics demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with a DR-based Schreier FOM of 170.9 dB.</br>

The sensor data is captured by a 16-channel CDMA-like capacitance-to-digital converter for training/inference at the edge device. Unlike the conventional approach where the capacitive information is recovered before further signal processing, our proposed system approach takes advantage of the capability of the machine learning (ML) algorithms and directly processes the code-modulated signals without demodulation. As a result, it reduces the input data throughput fed into the ML algorithms by 20×. The on-site ML implementation significantly reduces decision-making latency and lowers the required data throughput for wireless transmission by at least 4×. The highest testing classification accuracy of our system achieved is 99.7%, with a <0.1% difference from the conventional demodulated sensing scheme.</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents an NMOS digital low-dropout regulator (LDO) with fast transient response and ultra-low quiescent current, to provide a tunable power supply for nearthreshold voltage computing circuits in internet-of-things (IoT) devices. An LDO with an NMOS power transistor can enjoy the intrinsic fast transient response of the source-follower-like power stage, contributing to the proportional (P) part of the control loop. A shift-register-based digital control serves as an excellent candidate for the integral (I) part of the control loop. In addition, we propose a NAND-gate-based high-pass analog path (NAP) as the derivative (D) part of the loop, making the whole control scheme a complete PID control, therefore, achieving a fast transient response. We fabricated two versions of the prototype chip, one with a 30-pF on-chip load capacitor and a fast-transient on-chip load, and the other with no load capacitor, in 28-nm CMOS. The proposed NMOS digital LDO with NAP can handle the load transient of 160 mA/ns with 810-nA quiescent current, achieving 117-mV voltage undershoot. With the proposed techniques, we can achieve nearly two orders of better FoM when comparing it to the state-of-the-art works.</br>

Also maintains the efficiency of >20% for the input power range of -16 ~ 0 dBm. Also studied and analysed the implication of Wi-Fi bandwidth (72 MHz), OFDM modulation, and 64- QAM modulation on the efficiency and sensitivity of the system concerning continuous input signal.

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents a switched capacitor network (SCN)-based bandgap voltage reference (BGR) circuit designed and implemented in a 65nm standard CMOS process with a wide temperature range, high precision, low supply voltage and low power consumption for IoT device application. The proposed BGR employs a 2x charge pump with ripple optimization design to supply the VEB generator, which can relax VDD from 0.9V to 0.5V. A proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) current source is proposed to bias the PNP BJT in order to reduce the nonlinearity of VEB. Moreover, a voltage divider SCN with low leakage consideration to form the complementary to absolute temperature (CTAT) voltage is designed to reduce the nonlinearity of its coefficient, while a seriesparallel SCN with adjusted clock swing to form the PTAT voltage is designed to improve the line regulation of the BGR. The measurement result shows that the proposed BGR has a temperature coefficient (TC) of 42 ppm/°C at 0.5V supply within −40 °C to 120 °C. The line regulation is 3.2mV/V or 0.64%/V from 0.5V to 1V. Based on 6-chip test result, it shows a 3σ/µ variation of 3.08% before trimming, while 0.36% after trimming.</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents a digital battery management unit (BMU) with built-in resistance (BIR) compensation, modulated frequency detection (MFD), and multi-mode protection (MMP) techniques to realize fast, efficient and safe charging. The charger incorporates the proposed BMU based on the low-dropout (LDO) regulator. With BIR compensation, a large rated current in the proposed pulsed constant current (PCC) mode charges the battery, and reduces the charging time by omitting the constantvoltage (CV) mode. The MFD technique allows continuous monitoring and obtains precise BIR compensation with accelerating sampling speed. The MMP technique can alleviate safety concerns while charging, including over-voltage protection (OVP), over-current protection (OCP), and the proposed accidental fluctuation protection (AFP). The digital BMU, implemented in 28 nm CMOS, occupies 0.014 of silicon area. 𝐦𝐦𝟐 Experimental results show that the proposed circuit saves 73.3% of charging time with 1.5A charging current, and 21.5% ADC dynamic power with 1A charging current. For the digital controller IC, the power consumption is 59.1 µW.</br>

				<strong>Title: A 0.04% BER Strong PUF with Cell-Bias-Based CRPs Filtering and Background Offset Calibration</strong> </br>
				<strong>Authors:</strong> JiaHao Liu, Yan Zhu, Chi-Hang Chan, and Rui Paulo Martins</br>
				<strong>Institutes:</strong> State Key Laboratory of Analog and Mixed-Signal VLSI, University of Macau, Macao, China</br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents a low bit error rate (BER) strong PUF based on the dynamically amplified subthreshold current array (DA-SCA) with cell-bias-based challenge-response-pairs (CRPs) filtering method. The highly nonlinear subthreshold characteristic of the DA-SCA ensures a strong resilience to machine learning (ML) attacks and it simultaneously achieves low power and compact area. The current difference of two SCAs originated by the manufacturing process is amplified and converted into a voltage difference which is further digitized by the background offset-calibrated oscillator collapse-based comparator. Fabricated in 65 nm CMOS LP technology, the 64- bit DA-SCA PUF shows an average BER of 4.7% in the worst case for the temperature range of -20 to 80°C and a supply variation of ±10%. Moreover, the proposed cell-bias-based CRPs filtering method dramatically suppresses the BER to 0.04% while discarding only 9.5% CRPs. The power consumption of the proposed PUF is merely 2.4 µW at 125 Kb/s and it occupies 0.024 mm2, including the on-chip calibration circuit. The proposed PUF demonstrates resistance against machine learning (ML) attacks across 100K training samples, limiting the prediction accuracy to ~50%.</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents a nonlinear digital decoder (reconstruction filter) for incremental delta-sigma modulators. This decoder utilizes both the magnitude and pattern information of the modulator output to achieve accurate input estimation. Compared to the conventional linear filters with the same oversampling ratio, it can improve the converter’s signal-toquantization noise ratio (SQNR) by a few dB to a few 10’s of dB with slight thermal noise performance degradation. Using the proposed decoder, the modulator’s OSR can be a few times less while achieving the same resolution and data rate, thus minimizing the modulator as well as its peripheral circuits’ energy consumption. In this paper, the proposed decoder is optimized for digital implementation, with its function being verified using a modulator prototype. This decoder is mainly designed for dc or near-dc signal conversions and it does not provide frequency notches.</br>

				<strong>Institutes:</strong> School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China </br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> Aiming at reducing the complexity of minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, this paper proposes a detection algorithm with high convergence rate and an efficient hardware architecture based on second-order Richardson iteration (SORI). In the proposed algorithm, a pre-iteration-based initialization method is presented to accelerate the convergence without extra complexity. In addition, the approximation of relaxation factor and the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) is introduced to further reduce computing load. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the advantages of the proposed algorithm in fast convergence and low complexity, and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can efficiently approach MMSE performance. Based on this algorithm, a flexible hardware architecture is designed with deeply pipelined to support 128×U (8 ≤ U ≤ 32) massive MIMO detection with the configurable number of iterations, and a folded dual-mode systolic array (DMSA) is fully utilized to achieve the flexibility with low hardware consumption. Implemented on Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA and SMIC 40nm CMOS technology, the proposed detector is competitive in terms of energy and area efficiency compared to state-of-the-art iterative detectors, and it can adapt to the varied channel condition and the number of users in massive MIMO systems.</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper proposes a low power area-efficient multi-mode voltage clamper circuit called pseudo differential pair and applies it into an error amplifier (EA) which can be used in DC-DC converters as a practical design example. In addition to a normal amplifying mode, the error amplifier has two extra operation modes with the help of the voltage clamper, which can limit the maximum output voltage and the maximum sink current, respectively. By inserting this pseudo differential pair of only three transistors in the intermediate stage of the amplifier, a voltage-current feedback is introduced to achieve the voltage limiting function without bringing resistive load to the output stage or unwanted effects to the input stage. The frequency compensation of the EA is also reused in the voltage limiting loop to make the whole block more compact. The circuit is implemented in a 0.35 μm BCD process. The verification results match the theoretical analysis very well, which proves that the proposed voltage clamper can effectively enhance transient response of the converter control loop and improve system reliability. Only additional 0.001689 mm2 active area is occupied for about 2X transient speed improvement with fair open loop amplifying performance.</br>

				<strong>Title: A 108 F2/bit Fully Reconfigurable RRAM PUF Based on Truly Random Dynamic Entropy of Jitter Noise</strong> </br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, we present a fully reconfigurable resistive random access memory (RRAM) physical unclonable function (PUF) based on the truly random dynamic entropy of the ubiquitous jitter noise, which is intrinsically different from most previously demonstrated PUF implementations with semiconductor fabrication’s process variation as the static entropy source. In addition, the proposed RRAM PUF is operated by configuring the mainstream RRAM cells to either high resistance state (for ‘1’) or low resistance state (for ‘0’), according to the customized ring oscillator (RO) true random number generator’s digital output that is determined by the random jitter noise. By completely removing the need of dedicated split resistance circuitry (SRC) in existing RRAM PUFs, the proposed implementation is fully compatible with the SET/RESET operations of the RRAM array for mainstream memory applications, leading to minimized design overhead and enhanced reliability without SRC-caused error bits. Fabricated using 130 nm standard complementarymetal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process plus post-processing dedicated to the RRAM devices, the proposed RRAM PUF cell features an ultra-compact footprint of 1.82 µm2 (i.e., 108 F2), which is capable of generating ∼107 PUF bits per cell due to the time-variant property of jitter noise and the full reconfigurability of the RRAM PUF. This significantly innovates all the previous weak PUF implementations based on the static entropy source of process variation, where the maximum bit number per PUF cell is always limited and fixed after the chip fabrication. Meanwhile, ultra-low native unstable bits of 0.28% and bit error rate (BER) per 10◦C of 0.03% can be achieved for the fabricated RRAM PUF. Moreover, by passing the widely-adopted bias test, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) test and autocorrelation function (ACF) test under various VT conditions, the true randomness of the customized RO TRNG’ dynamic entropy is validated using 65 nm standard CMOS process. Compared with the state-of-the-art weak PUF implementations, the native unstable bits is improved by 5.36× and the BER per 10◦C is improved by 4×, even under the widest operating temperature range from −50◦C to 150◦C.</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> An ultra-low quiescent current dual-mode buck converter system is designed for IoT application, which includes a double clock time (DCT) and a pulse-width-modulation (PWM) control modes. The proposed DCT mode can reduce the conversion loss over a wide loading range from nA-to-mA and achieve seamless mode transition from DCT to PWM control. Implemented in a 0.18µm CMOS, this converter achieves a peak efficiency of 92.7%/94.7% in DCT/PWM and >80% efficiency from 10 4 to 50 mA (5000x), with a wide input voltage from 2 V to 5 V. A quiescent current of 470 nA including bandgap voltage reference and internal oscillator is achieved. The DCT-to-PWM mode selection mechanism achieves an undershoot of 80 mV at 11 µs recovery time when load current jumps from 6.67 µA to 50 mA.</br>

				<strong>Title: A U-Band PLL Using Implicit Distributed Resonators for Sub-THz Wireless Transceivers in 40 nm CMOS</strong> </br>
				<strong>Authors:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Institutes:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> A U-band phase-locked loop (PLL) with implicit distributed resonators in the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) and injection-locked frequency divider (ILFD) using 40 nm CMOS is investigated in this paper. While LC-based, transformer-based, and distributed resonators are typically adopted for mm-wave and sub-terahertz applications, implicit distributed resonators are proposed to enhance the oscillation frequency of the VCO and expand the locking range of the ILFD. The operating principles and the characteristics of the proposed implicit distributed resonators are discussed for intuitive insight. The presented PLL occupies 0.53 mm2 core area and has 81.8 mW power consumption. The PLL achieves a measured frequency range of 8.15 GHz (16%) from 46.75 GHz to 54.9 GHz. The measured phase noise is -91.8 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset frequency from a carrier of 46.75 GHz. The proposed U-band PLL can provide a clear and stable local oscillation signal for the transceivers operating at mm-wave and sub-terahertz (sub-THz) frequency band.</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> We present the first Gallium Nitride (GaN)-based demodulator system dedicated to demodulating Load-Shift Keying (LSK) modulated signals that can operate at high temperature (HT). GaN500 technology is adopted to implement the proposed demodulator. Stable DC output characteristics of epitaxial AlGaN/GaN Heterojunction Field Effect Transistors (HFETs) operating at up to 500ºC enable designing HT ICs. Conventional digital gates such as inverters, NAND2, NAND3, delay elements and a D Flip-Flop are employed to implement the proposed demodulator. The demodulation system is fabricated on a 2.67 mm2 silicon carbide (SiC) substrate and experimentally validated at 160oC, whereas the building blocks (inverters and NANDs) show a stable operation at HT up to 400oC. A minimum of 1 V amplitude difference can be detected between the high voltage level (HVL = ± 5 V) and low voltage level (LVL = ± 4 V) of an applied LSK modulated signal to recover transmitted digital data. Two high-voltage supply levels (±14 V) are required to operate the system. Its total power consumption is 3.4 W. </br>

				<strong>Title: A Multi-class Objects Detection Coprocessor with Dual Feature Space and Weighted Softmax</strong> </br>
				<strong>Authors:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Institutes:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> A critical mission for mobile robot vision is to detect and classify different objects with low power consumption. In this paper, we propose a multi-class object detection coprocessor using the combinational feature of the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) together with weighted Softmax classifier. The architecture is compact and hardware-friendly since the cell-based feature extraction unit and block-level normalization reuse the SRAMs for storing one-row cell and one-row block. Meanwhile, the working frequency of the feature extraction and block-normalization unit is synchronized to the image sensor for low dynamic power. Furthermore, for satisfying the intrinsically feature of the hardware, an only-once sliding-detection-window (OOSDW) mechanism is developed for object detection and classification in different sizes. The classification result of our method with dual feature space and Softmax classifier outperforms 80% previous classical approaches in the Fashion MNIST dataset. The experimental result shows that the hardware-resource usage of the FPGA implementation, which is capable of 60 fps VGA video. It is similar or even less than that of previous work using only the HOG feature and single-class classifier.</br>

				<strong>Institutes:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> The future satellites for scientific missions require ever more sensible instrumentations to detect new phenomena, which is extremely sensitive to electromagnetic disturbance. For this reason, in this paper, an inductorless DC/DC converter with very low electromagnetic emission levels is presented. It, avoiding the use of cumbersome transformers and inductors, is able to converter wide input voltage range, from 6 V to 60 V, in two points of load at 5 V and 1.65 V, saving weight and space. An innovative insulating stage, based on Switched-Capacitor architecture, is introduced in the converter to increase its fault-tolerant property. The whole converter is fabricated in 0.35 µm HV-CMOS technology and electrically characterized by experimental measurements. Specific tests for space compliance were performed as Total Ionization Dose and Single Event Effect tests, highlighting the feasibility use of the converter in Earth-Moon travels. </br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> In the natural and practical scenario, the captured video sequence under bad weather situations or low light conditions often suffers from poor visibility and low-contrast problems. This hurts the performance of the high-level processing, e.g. object tracking or recognition. In this paper, we develop an FPGA-based low-visibility enhancement accelerator for video sequence by adaptive histogram equalization with dynamic clipthreshold (AHEwDC) which is determined by the visibility assessment. The main goal is to improve the low visibility with high image quality for both hazy and low-light video sequences in realtime. Firstly, a concept to quantify the visual perception based on supervised learning is to estimate the visibility score. Then, to avoid the problem of noise amplification in the conventional method, we propose a visibility assessment model to find an optimal clip-threshold. The contrast energy of gray channel, yellow-blue channel and red-green channel, average saturation, and gradients are statistical features in the model to describe the visibility of an image. Finally, to meet the speed requirement for video sequence processing, a specified hardware architecture for both visibility assessment and AHEwDC is implemented on FPGA. Besides, a mean spatial filter for cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the AHE is developed for suppressing the noise caused by a single-color local region. The demonstration system on the DE1-SoC platform with the Intel Cyclone V FPGA device with the max working frequency of 75.84 MHz is capable of processing 30 fps FHD (1920×1080) video.</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> Present universal serial bus (USB) battery chargers often suffer from limitations to meet the increasing demand for quick charging due to compromised power efficiency and complicated hardware implementation. In this paper, we propose a charge unifiable (QU) control scheme that enables a battery charger to improve power efficiency in a low-profile hardware manner. This scheme features fully soft-switching (vis-à-vis hard switching) and single control scheme (vis-à-vis multiple) for distinct constant current (CC) and constant voltage (CV) charging modes. To the best of authors’ knowledge, the proposed QU control scheme is the first to simultaneously offer fully softswitching, innate CC-and-CV regulation, and seamless CC-to-CV transition. To verify the proposed design, we monolithically realize a low-profile high-efficiency fast battery charger based on this scheme. The prototype embodying a tiny 470-nH output inductor supports a maximum input voltage of 16V, output voltage of 2.2-4.2 V, output current of 0.1-2 A, and peak power efficiency of 96.2%. When benchmarked against state-of-the-art counterparts, the proposed charger features at least 2.1× smaller inductor and 7.2% higher power efficiency at both the maximum and the minimum output power charging scenarios. Further, this charger is the only design that features ≥91% power efficiency in the whole load range.</br>

				<strong>Title: Machine Learning-based Approach for Hardware Faults Prediction</strong> </br>
				<strong>Authors:</strong> Kasem Khalil, Omar Eldash, Ashok Kumar, and Magdy Bayoumi</br>
				<strong>Institutes:</strong> Center of Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, USA</br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> Hardware failures are undesired but a common problem in circuits. Such failures are inherently due to the aging of circuitry or variation in circumstances. In critical systems, customers demand the system never to fail. Several self-healing and fault tolerance techniques have been proposed in the literature for recovering a circuitry from a fault. Such techniques come to the rescue when a fault has already occurred but they are typically uninformed about the possibility of an impending failure (i.e., fault prediction), which can be used as a pre-stage to fault tolerance and self-healing. This paper presents an approach to early fault prediction of circuits. The proposed method uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to get the fault frequency signature, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to get the most important data with reduced dimension, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn and classify the fault. The proposed method is validated for working in different circuits by testing it using two circuits: comparator and amplifier. The comparator and amplifier are implemented using 45 nm technology on HSPICE to extract the failures dataset in terms of voltage, current, temperature, noise, and delay. This extracted data is used for training the proposed approach using Tensorflow. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of fault prediction at the transistor level for hardware system. The proposed approach considers aging, short-circuit, and open-circuit faults, and it provides a fault prediction accuracy of 98.93% and 98.91% for comparator and amplifier circuits, respectively. The proposed method is tested for two different circuits for its validation, and it consumes 1.08 W for Altera Arria 10 GX FPGA device.</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) have been shown to be robust to random bit-level noise, making aggressive voltage scaling attractive as a power-saving technique for both logic and SRAMs. In this work, we introduce the first fully programmable IoT end-node system-on-chip (SoC) capable of executing software-defined, hardware-accelerated BNNs at ultralow voltage. Our SoC exploits a hybrid memory scheme where error-vulnerable SRAMs are complemented by reliable standardcell memories to safely store critical data under aggressive voltage scaling. On a prototype in 22nm FDX technology, we demonstrate that both the logic and SRAM voltage can be dropped to 0.5V without any accuracy penalty on a BNN trained for the CIFAR- 10 dataset, improving energy efficiency by 2.2X w.r.t. nominal conditions. Furthermore, we show that the supply voltage can be dropped to 0.42V (50% of nominal) while keeping more than 99% of the nominal accuracy (with a bit error rate ∼1/1000). In this operating point, our prototype performs 4Gop/s (15.4 Inference/s on the CIFAR-10 dataset) by computing up to 13 binary ops per pJ, achieving 22.8 Inference/s/mW while keeping within a peak power envelope of 674uW – low enough to enable always-on operation in ultra-low power smart cameras, longlifetime environmental sensors, and insect-sized pico-drones.</br>

				<strong>Title: Ultra-low Power CMOS Image Sensor with Two-step Logical Shift Algorithm-based Correlated Double Sampling Scheme </strong> </br>

				<strong>Institutes:</strong> Department of semiconductor science, Dongguk University, Seoul, South Korea</br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents an ultra-low power counter structure for a column-parallel single-slope analog-to-digital converter (SS-ADC) in CMOS image sensors. The proposed counter employs a two-step logical shift algorithm-based correlated double sampling (CDS) scheme. The logical shift algorithm can reduce parasitic capacitances, driving frequency, and inner toggling nodes by using the minimum number of transistors and a single-direction counter structure. Moreover, the two-step counting and double data rate scheme in the LSB counter can halve the operating clock frequency, resulting in further decreased power consumption. A prototype sensor was fabricated using a 110 nm CMOS image sensor process. The measurement results show that the proposed SS-ADC with two-step counter consumes 2.2 µW power per column and shows a differential nonlinearity of +0.38/ −0.25 LSB and an integral nonlinearity of +0.75/ −0.5 LSB. The total power consumption is 2.25 mW for 640 × 480 effective image resolution at 60 frame rates with 3.3 V/1.5 V supply voltage.</br>

				<strong>Title: LDO with Improved Common Gate Class AB OTA Handles any Load Capacitors and Provides Fast Response to Load Transients</strong> </br>

				<strong>Institutes:</strong> Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Romania; Infineon Technologies, Bucharest, Romania</br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper proposes an LDO with fast response to load transients that can handle any practical capacitive loads. These features are mainly due to a novel frequency compensation circuit tailored for its error amplifier, which is based on an improved version of the popular common gate amplifier. A simple yet effective approach to the small-signal analysis of LDO with multiple feedback loops is employed to analyse intuitively the LDO and derive key design constraints. Simulation and measurement results performed on a test chip implemented in standard 130nm CMOS process validated the proposed LDO. It requires only 0.7µA quiescent current but exhibits an excellent response to load transients: when the load current jumps from 0A to 100mA in 1μs the output voltage presents an undershoot of 76mV and an overshoot of 198mV, without decoupling capacitors. It compares well against seven LDOs designed with common gate error amplifiers for similar levels of supply voltage, output voltage and current and against seven fast LDOs employing different error amplifiers. A figure-of-merit that considers the quiescent current, the maximum load current and capacitance, as well as the output voltage deviation, yielded a value for our LDO 39.8 times better than for the nearer competitor that employs common gate amplifier and 6 times better than the one employing a different error amplifier. When considering edge time and process scaling the performance of the proposed LDO is 4.8, respectively 4.5, times better than the second best in both comparisons.</br>

				<strong>Title: A 100 MHz, 0.8-to-1.1 V, 170 mA Digital LDO with 8-Cycles Mean Settling Time and 9-Bit Regulating Resolution in 180-nm CMOS</strong> </br>
				<strong>Authors:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Institutes:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents an all-digital low dropout regulator (DLDO) with high regulating resolution and fast transient tracking by combining novel interval-searching algorithm and recover acceleration techniques. By bringing forth an enhanced interval-searching algorithm (ISA) with 9-bit register regulating precision, the output can be stabilized within 8 cycles when the load changes. A recover acceleration (RA) technique is proposed to improve the transient response and stability. The DLDO is fabricated with standard 180-nm CMOS process. The proposed DLDO needs 390 pF output capacitance and can provide as much as 170 mA load current. The measured load regulation is 0.11 mV/mA at 0.9 V output with 160 mA load current range. The maximum current efficiency is up to 99.71%. The two FOMs of 2.03 ps and 0.362 pF are also achieved to illustrate the merits of this design.</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This brief presents a 16-electrode electrical impedance tomography (EIT) system for hand gesture recognition. The hardware of the system is based on integrated circuits including a 12-bit high spectral purity current-steering DAC implemented in 0.18 µm CMOS technology, a current driver and an instrumentation amplifier in 0.35 µm CMOS technology. Both 2D and 3D EIT electrode arrangements were tested for hand gesture recognition. It is shown that using machine learning algorithms, eight hand gestures can be distinguished from the measured bio-impedance data with an accuracy of 97.5% when the electrodes are placed on a single wristband, and an accuracy of 99.5% with the same number of electrodes distributed on two wristbands for 3D EIT measurement. In particular 3D EIT demonstrated significant superiority in its ability to discriminate between gestures with similar muscle contractions.</br>

				<strong>Title: 1.5-to-3.0 GHz Tunable RF Σ∆ ADC with a Fixed Set of Coefficients and a Programmable Loop Delay</strong> </br>
				<strong>Authors:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Institutes:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, we present a tunable bandpass RF Sigma-Delta modulator with a fixed set of coefficients. The sampling frequency,fs, is tuned with the center frequency,f0,in order to maintain a fixed normalized center frequency,f0/fs. Any variation in the loop delay is compensated to maintain a fixed normalized loop-delay td/Ts. The bandpass Sigma-Delta,reported in this paper, is based on an LC resonator with tunable center frequency from 1.5 to 3.0 GHz and a corresponding sampling frequency from 6.0 to 12.0 GHz. For an oversampling ratio of 64, the ADC achieves the same SNDR of 37 dB and the same Dynamic Range of 45 dB over the complete tuning range. This performance is achieved for a band with of 47 MHz at 1.5 GHz and a Bandwidth of 93 MHz at 3 GHz. The ADC,fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process, consumes only 13 mW from a 1.2 V supply. In order to compare this circuit with the state of the art, we use not only the conventional ADC Figure of Merit but we also use a Figure of Merit dedicated to RF circuits.In this case, the measured chip center frequency, noise figure and non-linearity are also taken into account in the comparison. </br>

				<strong>Title: A 50μW Fully Differential Interface Amplifier with a Current Steering Class AB Output Stage for PPG and NIRS Recordings</strong> </br>
				<strong>Institutes:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents a low-power fully differential optical sensor interface amplifier for photoplethysmography (PPG) and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) recordings. The proposed amplifier employs a stacked current reuse input stage that provides a DC biasing voltage for the photodiode, reducing the parasitic capacitance. The output stage exploits a fully differential current steering class AB topology with a self-regulated common mode voltage, providing a 70µA input current range with minimized quiescent current. Moreover, the interface amplifier can be reconfigured as either single-ended mode suitable for photo detectors biased at a high voltage or fully differential mode for those biased at a low voltage. This amplifier is implemented in a standard 0.18µm CMOS process and characterized experimentally. Measurement results show that, with a 1.5V supply, the amplifier can provide up to 1V biasing voltage for the photodiode and consumes a static power of around 50µW. It achieves a dynamic range of 97dB in fully differential mode with an input referred noise of 67pArms in 32Hz band and 102dB in single -ended mode with an input referred noise of 582pArms.</br>

				<strong>Title: Efficient FPGA Implementation of K-Nearest-Neighbor Search Algorithm for 3D LIDAR Localization and Mapping in Smart Vehicles</strong> </br>
				<strong>Authors:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Institutes:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> K-Nearest-Neighbor search (KNN) has been extensively used in the localization and mapping based on 3D laser point clouds in smart vehicles. Considering the real-time requirement of localization and stringent battery constraint in smart vehicles, it is a great challenge to develop highly energy-efficient KNN implementations. Unfortunately, previous KNN implementations either cannot build search data structure efficiently or cannot search efficiently in massive and unevenly distributed point clouds. To solve the issue, we propose a new framework to optimize the implementation of KNN on FPGAs. First, we propose a novel data structure with a spatial subdivision method, which can be built efficiently even for massive point clouds. Second, based on our data structure, we propose a KNN search algorithm which is able to search in unevenly distributed point clouds efficiently. We have implemented the new framework on both FPGA and GPU. Energy efficiency results show that our proposed method is on average 2.1 times and 6.2 times higher than the state-of-the-art implementations of KNN on FPGA and GPU platform, respectively.</br>

				<strong>Title: A SAR-ADC-Assisted DC-DC Buck Converter with Fast Transient Recovery</strong> </br>
				<strong>Authors:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Institutes:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This brief presents a successive-approximationregister (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) assisted DC-DC buck converter, which operates in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) and achieves fast load transient recovery characteristics. The power inductor of the buck converter uses the bond-wire inductance. During the load transient, the dynamic low-power SAR ADC samples the converterís undershoot/overshoot output voltage and controls the programmable current pump circuit to charge/discharge the output capacitor, thus speeding up and smoothing the load transient response. An additional compensation circuit is also designed to ensure the stability of the voltage mode control loop and the current pump. The chip fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS technology occupies an area of 1 mm2 . The converter, switching at 100 MHz, achieves a peak power efficiency of 81% when VIN = 1.2 V, VOUT = 1 V and ILoad = 50 mA. When the load current steps from 2 mA to 50 mA, the measured undershoot/overshoot voltage is 101/92 mV, and the recovery time is 175/406 ns.</br>

				<strong>Title: Unified Hardware for High-Throughput AES-Based Authenticated Encryptions</strong> </br>
				<strong>Authors:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Institutes:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents an efficient unified hardware for up-to-date authenticated encryptions with associated data (AEADs). Although some major AEADs share several fundamental components (e.g., advanced encryption standard (AES), block chaining, and XOR-Encryption-XOR (XEX) scheme), each AEAD is equipped with a unique mode of operation and/or subfunctions, which makes it difficult to integrate various AEADs in a hardware efficiently. The proposed hardware in this paper efficiently unifies the fundamental components to perform a set of AEADs with minimal area and power overheads. The proposed configurable datapath is adapted to a set of peripheral operations (e.g., block chaining and XEX), dictated by the given AEAD algorithm. In this study, we also demonstrate the validity of the proposed hardware through an experimental design adapted to four AES-based AEADs. Consequently, we confirm that the proposed hardware can perform the four AEADs with quite smaller area than the sum of the each dedicated AEAD hardware, comparable throughput and power consumption. In addition, we confirmed that the proposed hardware is superior to software implementation on general-purpose processor in terms of both throughput and power consumption.</br>

				<strong>Authors:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Institutes:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This study presents a reconfigurable Random Number Generator (RNG) based on transient effect of ring oscillators. Users can select a method based on the irregular sampling of a regular waveform or on the regular sampling of an irregular waveform to obtain a random bit sequence to be used in different applications, such as lightweight cryptography or high-security communication. The entropy is acquired by exploiting Transient Effect Ring Oscillators (TEROs). The proposed fully-digital RNG structure is firstly implemented on a Zynq-7000 FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) without any post-processing method such as the Von Neumann. In addition to the RNG structure, an on-the-line test module based on FIPS 140-2 is also implemented to check the randomness of the produced data statistically in real time. Users can change the statistical test parameters according to their desired security levels. Finally, an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) implementation of the proposed RNG is done following the Cadence digital design flow for the TSMC 180 nm CMOS process. The implemented ASIC design occupies an area of 0.85 mm x 0.85 mm and the estimated power required is 11.827 mW.</br>

				<strong>Title: A Robust Hardened Latch Featuring Tolerance to Double-Node-Upset in 28nm CMOS for Spaceborne Application</strong> </br>
				<strong>Authors:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Institutes:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> Soft errors induced by high energy particles have been a severe concern in integrated circuits. Especially in advanced nanoscale technology nodes, the phenomenon of multi-node-upset caused by charge sharing is becoming a crucial issue. However, this problem remains a challenge as there are only few mitigation methods. This study demonstrates a cost-efficient latch named CROUT featuring double-node-upset tolerance. Integrating coupled Schmitt-triggers and four always-on high-threshold transistors, CROUT is highly reliable in the presence of double-node-upset. To further validate this, a test chip was fabricated in the 28nm CMOS process and tested in a heavy-ion radiation environment. The experimental results indicated that the radiation tolerance is about 2x higher than the standard latches. Moreover, compared to other state-of-the-art multi-node-upset tolerant latches, its logarithmic power-delay-product (PDP) is reduced by ~6x. The results are promising and offer new high reliable and cost-effective latch dedicated to the aerospace field, which further can be made into a standard cell for application in large-scale circuits.</br>

				<strong>Title: A ReRAM-Based Computing-in-Memory Convolutional-Macro with Customized 2T2R Bit-cell for AIoT chip IP Applications</strong> </br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> To reduce the energy-consuming and time latency incurred by Von Neumann architecture, this paper developed a complete computing-in-memory (CIM) convolutional macro based on ReRAM array for the convolutional layers of a LeNet-like convolutional neural network (CNN). We binarized the input layer and the first convolutional layer to get higher accuracy. The proposed ReRAM-CIM convolutional macro is suitable as an IP core for any binarized neural networks' convolutional layers. This work customized a bit-cell consisting of 2T2R ReRAM cells, regarded $\mathbf{9 \times 8}$ bit-cells as one unit to achieve high hardware compute accuracy, great read/compute speed, and low power consuming. The ReRAM-CIM convolutional macro achieved 50 ns product-sum computing time for one complete convolutional operation in a convolutional layer in the customized convolutional neural network (CNN), with an accuracy of 96.96\% on MNIST database and a peak energy efficiency of 58.82 TOPS/W. </br>

				<strong>Title: A CMRR Enhancement Circuit Employing Gm-Controllable Output Stage for Capacitively Coupled Instrumentation Amplifier</strong> </br>
				<strong>Authors:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Institutes:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> The capacitively coupled instrumentation amplifier (CCIA) is broadly used for neural signal acquisition. Although it is suitable for various biopotential recording applications, the CCIA is vulnerable to capacitor mismatches, which degrades the commonmode rejection ratio (CMRR). The neural signals with small amplitude can be easily contaminated by large-amplitude commonmode (CM) interferences due to the degraded CMRR. This paper presents a CMRR enhancement circuit for the CCIA, with which the capacitor mismatches can be compensated in a power-efficient manner. In the proposed CCIA, the gains of a pair of output stages are controlled separately to reject the output signals generated by the CM interferers in the presence of capacitor mismatches. Employing the proposed CMRR enhancement scheme, the implemented CCIA achieves a CMRR over 90 dB from 10 Hz to 1 kHz and 3.4-μVrms integrated input-referred noise (IRN) while only consuming 1.5 μW per channel.</br>

				<strong>Title: A Calibration-free Ring-Oscillator PLL with Gain Tracking Achieving 9% Jitter Variation over PVT</strong> </br>
				<strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaofeng Yang, Chi-Hang Chan, Yan Zhu and R. P. Martins</br>
				<strong>Institutes:</strong> State Key Laboratory of Analog and Mixed-Signal VLSI / Institute of Microelectronics; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macao, China</br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents a calibration-free and lowjitter phase-locked loop (PLL) with small performance degradation over PVT. We introduce an open-loop discrete-time phase noise cancellation (OPDTPNC) technique to achieve a wideband filtering and circuit inner-gain-tracking for PVT stabilization. The OPDTPNC is an effective phase realignment that enables a filtering bandwidth ~1/4 of the reference clock frequency. Besides, with the common structures and PVT tracking bias for sampler and corrector of the OPDTPNC, the prototype PLL maintains its low jitter under a wide range of PVT variations. Eventually, by cascading a Type-II PLL with the OPDTPNC, the proposed hybrid PLL attains the benefits of both Type-II PLL and injection-locked clock multiplier (ILCM). Fabricated in 28-nm CMOS with an active area of 0.023mm2 it consumes 4.1 mV from a 1 V supply with a reference spur of -63 dBc. The measured rms jitter of the 2.4 GHz PLL is 248 fs and 686 fs with and without OPDTPNC, respectively. When the temperature, supply and loop gain vary from 0 to 100˚C, ±5%, and 6dB, respectively, the jitter performance only degrades less than 9%.</br>

				<strong>Institutes:</strong> Technische Universiteit Delft</br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, we propose a new scheme to directly power a 4.9–5.6 GHz LC oscillator from a recursive switchedcapacitor DC-DC converter. A finite-state machine is integrated to automatically adjust the conversion ratio and switching frequency of the converter such that its DC output voltage is within ±5% of the desired 1V across input voltage range 1.3–2.2 V and <2 mA load current conditions. A gate-driver circuit is embedded in each switch of the converter to guarantee constant on-resistance across PVT variations without sacrificing device reliability. Furthermore, a spur reduction block (SRB) is embedded in the oscillator to suppress the ripple induced spurs by stabilizing its tail current. Both the converter and the oscillator are implemented in 40-nm CMOS technology. The measured peak power efficiency of the converter is 87%, while its spot noise is <1.5 nV/pHz, which does not degrade the phase noise of the oscillator. The SRB suppresses the spur to < −65 dBc under the 30 mVpp ripple of the converter.</br>

				<strong>Institutes:</strong> School of Microelectronics, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China; School of Microelectronics, Xidian University, Xi’an, China</br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents an 8×-oversampling successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with configurable center frequency of noise shaping (NS), which permits the signal passband being configured to any one of the 8 equally divided sub-bands in the first Nyquist band. The configurable noise shaping is realized by an error-feedback (EF) structure with an adjustable 2-tap switched-capacitor (SC) FIR filter. Taking advantage of the sub-bands’ symmetry, the selection of the 8 sub-bands are determined by only a 2-bit controlled variable capacitor in the FIR filter in addition to one bit indicating which half-band the target sub-band is in. As a result, the configuration circuit is area efficient and introduces very little parasitic into the critical EF path. A 2-stage clock-controlled amplifier (CAMP) is proposed for the EF path, which can ensure gain and speed simultaneously through allocating reasonable currents into the gain stage and the driving stage separately. Implemented in 65-nm CMOS process, measurement results under a sampling rate of 10 MSPS show that the prototype achieves signal-to-noise-and-distortion (SNDR) of 71.9~74.6dB in the 8 sub-bands with 625-KHz bandwidth, corresponding to a Scherier FoM of 171.4 -174 dB. The ADC prototype occupies 0.03-mm2 core area and consumes 70-μW average power at 1-V supply voltage.</br>

				<strong>Institutes:</strong> Department of Industrial Engineering of the University of Salerno, Fisciano (SA), Italy; System Research and Applications, STMicroelectronics, Agrate Brianza (MB), Italy</br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> A custom Human Activity Recognition system is presented based on the resource-constrained Hardware (HW) implementation of a new partially binarized Hybrid Neural Network. The system processes data in real-time from a single triaxial accelerometer, and is able to classify between 5 different human activities with an accuracy of 97.5% when the Output Data Rate of the sensor is set to 25 Hz. The new Hybrid Neural Network (HNN) has binary weights (i.e. constrained to +1 or −1) but uses non-binarized activations for some layers. This, in conjunction with a custom pre-processing module, achieves much higher accuracy than Binarized Neural Network. During pre-processing, the measurements are made independent from the spatial orientation of the sensor by exploiting a reference frame transformation. A prototype has been realized in a Xilinx Artix 7 FPGA, and synthesis results have been obtained with TSMC CMOS 65 nm LP HVT and 90 nm standard cells. Best result shows a power consumption of 6.3 μW and an area occupation of 0.2 mm2 when real-time operations are set, enabling in this way, the possibility to integrate the entire HW accelerator in the auxiliary circuitry that normally equips inertial Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS).</br>

				<strong>Authors:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Institutes:</strong> </br>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> A low-cost random number generator (RNG) based on a tetrahedral ring oscillator, which can be utilized in cryptographic systems, is presented. The proposed design exploits two metastable events in the oscillator caused by turning on and off three additional inverters in the classical tetrahedral oscillator, which improves entropy. The design is implemented on FPGA as a proof of concept, but the ASIC implementation will be carried out in the future. A method has been devised to implement this circuit on FPGA. Techniques to increase randomness have been used, such as adjusting the sampling signal considering 1 and 0 balance of the output. The proposed design is compared with the classical tetrahedral oscillator based RNG, and it is observed to be better. The RNG is tested with the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) test suite to prove randomness. The design occupies an area of 0.0036mm2 with a power consumption of 200mW and a bit rate of 10Mb/s. The number of oscillators has been dropped by 60% compared to the classical method. </br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents a 9Gb/s transmitter for intra-panel interfaces, with dual-loop calibration and a 2D binary-segmented driver. The dual-loop calibration during the training period compensates the transmitter output for the variations in operating conditions such as supply voltage and reference current. The 2D binary-segmented driver provides wide range and high resolution output characteristics, and independent adjustments for VOD, VCM and FFE strength while maintaining signal integrity. The transmitter reduces power consumption by optimizing the output for the channel. A prototype chip, fabricated in a 55nm CMOS process, occupies 0.057mm2. It provides FFE strength from 0dB to 26.4dB, common-mode voltage from 260mV to 690mV, and differential output voltage from 100mVppd to 1200mVppd, which varies by less than 4% across supply voltage and reference current variations. It also consumes 36mW at a data-rate of 9Gb/s with a 1.2V supply.</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> It is essential but quite challenging to alleviate speech information loss and distortion while developing the speech processing algorithms in hearing aids. Recently, many speech enhancement methods based on deep learning are proven effective. However, most of the algorithms fail to achieve real-time processing, which is significant for hearing aids, especially for a smartphone-centered binaural hearing aid system. A supervised speech enhancement method based on an RNN structure is proposed to address the real-time problem. The problem is explored as a resource-constrained speech intelligibility improvement problem with the target of improving speech intelligibility at low SNR situations. Both the objective and subjective experimental results, using the standard evaluation metrics and the experiments on volunteers, respectively, have verified the superiority of the proposed method.</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> To improve the SpO$_2$ sensing system performance for hypoperfusion (low perfusion index) applications, this paper proposes a low-noise light-to-frequency converter scheme from two aspects. First, a low-noise photocurrent buffer is proposed by reducing the amplifier noise floor with a transconductance-boost (g$\rm{_m}$-boost) circuit structure. Second, a digital processing unit of pulse-frequency-duty-cycle modulation is proposed to minimize the quantization noise in the following timer by limiting the maximum output frequency. The proposed light-to-frequency sensor chip is designed and fabricated with a 0.35-$\mu$m CMOS process. The overall chip area is 1$\times$0.9 mm$^2$ and the typical total current consumption is about 1.8 mA from a 3.3-V power supply at room temperature. The measurement results prove the proposed functionality of output pulse duty cycle modulation, while the SNR of a typical 10-kHz output frequency is 59 dB with about 9-dB improvement when compared with the conventional design. In-system experimental results show that the minimum measurable PI using the proposed blood SpO$_2$ sensor could be as low as 0.06\% with 2-percentage-point error of SpO$_2$. The proposed chip is suitable for portable low-power high-performance blood oximeter devices especially for hypoperfusion applications.</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> Neurons are the primary building block of the nervous system. Exploring the mysteries of the brain in science or building a novel brain-inspired hardware substrate in engineering are inseparable from constructing an efficient biological neuron. Balancing the functional capability and the implementation cost of a neuron is a grand challenge in neuromorphic field. In this paper, we present a low-cost adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neuron, called SC-AdEx, for large-scale neuromorphic systems using stochastic computing. In the proposed model, arithmetic operations are performed on stochastic bit-streams with small and low-power circuitry. To evaluate the proposed neuron, we perform biological behavior analysis, including various firing patterns. Furthermore, the model is synthesized and implemented physically on FPGA as a proof of concept. Experimental results show that our model can precisely reproduce wide range biological behaviors as the original model, with higher computational performance and lower hardware cost against state-of-the-art AdEx hardware neurons.</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> A dual-mode stimulus chip with a built-in high voltage generator was proposed to offer a broad-range current or voltage stimulus patterns for biomedical applications. With an on-chip built-in high voltage generator, this stimulus chip could generate the required high voltage supply without additional supply voltage. With a nearly 20 V operating voltage, the overstress and reliability issues of the stimulus circuits were thoroughly considered and carefully addressed in this work. This stimulus system only requires an area of 0.22 mm2 per single channel and is fully on-chip implemented without any additional external components. The dual-mode stimulus chip was fabricated in a 0.25-μm 2.5V/5V/12V CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) process, which can generate the biphasic current or voltage stimulus pulses. The current level of stimulus is up to 5 mA, and the voltage level of stimulus can be up to 10 V. Moreover, this chip has been successfully applied to stimulate a guinea pig in an animal experiment. The proposed dual-mode stimulus system has been verified in electrical tests and also demonstrated its stimulation function in animal experiments.</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> MagnetoMyoGraphy (MMG) with superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) enabled the measurement of very weak magnetic fields (femto to pico Tesla) generated from the human skeletal muscles during contraction. However, SQUIDs are bulky, costly and require working in a temperature-controlled environment, limiting wide-spread clinical use. We introduce a low-profile magnetoelectric (ME) sensor with analog frontend circuitry that has sensitivity to measure pico-Tesla MMG signals at room temperature. It comprises magnetostrictive and piezoelectric materials, FeCoSiB/AlN. Accurate device modelling and simulation are presented to predict device fabrication process comprehensively using the finite element method (FEM) in COMSOL Multiphysics®. The fabricated ME chip with its readout circuit was characterized under a dynamic geomagnetic field cancellation technique. The ME sensor experiment validate a very linear response with high sensitivities of up to 378 V/T driven at a resonance frequency of fres = 7.76 kHz. Measurements show the sensor limit of detections of down to 175 pT/√Hz at resonance, which is in the range of MMG signals. Such a small-scale sensor has the potential to monitor chronic movement disorders and improve the end-user acceptance of human-machine interfaces.</br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> Bioimpedance analysis is a non-invasive and inexpensive technology to investigate the electrical properties of biological tissues. The analysis requires demodulation to extract the real and imaginary parts of the impedance. Conventional systems use complex architectures such as I-Q demodulation. In this paper, a very simple alternative time-to-digital demodulation method or ‘time stamp’ is proposed. It employs only three comparators to identify or stamp in the time domain, the crossing points of the excitation signal and the measured signal. In a CMOS proof of concept design, the accuracy of impedance magnitude and phase is 97.06% and 98.81% respectively over a bandwidth of 10 kHz to 500 kHz. The effect of fractional-N synthesis is analysed for the counter-based zero crossing phase detector obtaining a finer phase resolution (0.51˚ at 500 kHz) using a counter clock frequency (𝒇𝒄𝒍𝒌 = 12.5 MHz). Because of its circuit simplicity and ease of transmitting the time stamps, the method is very suited to implantable devices requiring low area and power consumption.</br>

				<strong>Title: Long-Term Bowel Sound Monitoring and Segmentation by Wearable Devices and Convolutional Neural Networks</strong> </br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> Bowel sounds (BSs), typically generated by the intestinal peristalses, are a significant physiological indicator of the digestive system's health condition. Recent progress in computerized BS analysis suggests that long-term BS monitoring provides a promising way of understanding the gastrointestinal status. However, long-term BS monitoring also brings several challenges. On the one hand, unlike the short-term abdominal auscultation, in the long-term monitoring, subjects cannot be immobilized all the time. Generally, they are allowed to behave freely within a specified room. In this sense, the wired electronic stethoscopes are not user-friendly. On the other hand, long-term BS monitoring generates massive data. How to pick the BS events-contained segments while ignoring those segments that only include background noises is challenging. In this study, a wearable BS monitoring system is presented. The system features a wearable BS sensor that can record BSs for days long and transmit them wirelessly in real-time. With the system, a total of 20 subjects' BS data under the hospital environment were collected. Each subject is recorded for 24 hours. Through manual screening and annotation, from every subject's BS data, 400 segments were extracted, in which half are BS event-contained segments. Thus, a BS dataset that contains 20 × 400 sound segments is formed. Afterward, CNNs are introduced for BS segment recognition. Specifically, this study proposes a novel CNN design method that makes it possible to transfer the popular CNN modules in image recognition into the BS segmentation domain. Experimental results show that in holdout evaluation with corrected labels, the designed CNN model achieves a moderate accuracy of 91.8% and the highest sensitivity of 97.0% compared with the similar works. In cross validation with noisy labels, the designed CNN delivers the best generability. By using a CNN visualizing technique—class activation maps, it is found that the designed CNN has learned the effective features of BS events. Finally, the proposed CNN design method is scalable to different sizes of datasets.</br>

				<strong>Title: A 0.46V-1.1V Transition-Detector with In-Situ Timing-Error Detection and Correction Based on Pulsed-Latch Design in AES Accelerator</strong> </br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> To overcome the minimum-delay constraint of latch based error detection and correction (EDAC) techniques, we propose a technique of using pulse latch and transition detector (TD). This method is also advantageous in no need of error recovery by time-borrowing characteristics of the latch. To detect timing violations and minimize the area overhead, we design a quick-response 15-transistor transition detector cover a wide-voltage range from near-threshold voltage (NTV) to SuperVth. Test chips are fabricated in 28nm CMOS process. Silicon measurements demonstrate that the whole design has achieved up to 64.3% energy saving with 180mV additional voltage scaling, compared to the conventional worst-case design at the expense of 4.3% area overhead.</br>

				<strong>Title: A Hybrid 3D Interconnect with 2x Bandwidth Density Employing Orthogonal Simultaneous Bidirectional Signaling for 3D NoC</strong> </br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong> For the first time, this work presents a wirelesswireline hybrid 3D interconnect that employs orthogonal simultaneous bidirectional signaling for 3D Network-on-chip to achieve 2x bandwidth density. We combine wireless near-field inductive coupling channel (NFIC) encompassing wireline through-silicon vias (TSV) to leverage orthogonal simultaneous bidirectional (SBD) signaling. This technique provides an efficient way of doubling interconnect bandwidth in the same area by means of passive wireless and wireline interconnects. The proposed hybrid 3D interconnect shows at least -70dB of NFICTSV isolation in the band of interest. We also present a comprehensive link analysis to derive the energy-area trade-off of an NFIC link and its fundamental performance limits. Further, we demonstrate on how equalization has the potential to decouple the fundamental energy-area tradeoff. The prototype transceiver measures a simultaneous bidirectional data and clock communication at an effective data rate of 6.6 Gb/s consuming 263 fJ/bit in 65 nm CMOS bulk process. The developed hybrid 3D interconnect architecture exhibits a 2× improved link performance over state-of-the-art 3D capacitive link. A hybrid 3D Network-on-chip (3D NoC) implementation is demonstrated using the proposed hybrid interconnect technology and shows a 50% lower area and cost for the same energy-delay-product (EDP) over the conventional TSV based links.</br>
